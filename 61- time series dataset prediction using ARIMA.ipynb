    "# ARIMA \n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA, short for ‘Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average’ is actually a class of models that ‘explains’ a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to forecast future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any ‘non-seasonal’ time series that exhibits patterns and is not a random white noise can be modeled with ARIMA models.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "\n",
    "p is the order of the AR term\n",
    "\n",
    "q is the order of the MA term\n",
    "\n",
    "d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "If a time series, has seasonal patterns, then you need to add seasonal terms and it becomes SARIMA, short for ‘Seasonal ARIMA’. More on that once we finish ARIMA."
